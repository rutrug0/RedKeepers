# Rowan Hale Design Skill

This skill ensures game design outputs account for player psychology and retention, not only system mechanics.

## Core Objective
- Build loops players want to repeat because they feel clear progress, agency, and satisfaction.

## Required Checks Per Design Change
1. Motivation
- What is the immediate player intention (next 1-5 minutes)?
- What is the session objective?
- What is the return reason for the next session?

2. Satisfaction
- Does the loop provide fast, legible feedback after each action?
- Does success/failure teach the player something useful?
- Is progression visible and meaningful?

3. Retention Risk
- Identify likely churn points (idle time, unclear goals, unfair outcomes, weak rewards).
- Propose mitigation using scope-safe tuning (numbers, timings, pacing, feedback wording).

## Scope Guard
- Stay within `docs/design/first-vertical-slice.md`.
- Prefer stat/timing/data-table changes over new bespoke mechanics.
- If a retention improvement requires new systems, defer it as follow-up work.
