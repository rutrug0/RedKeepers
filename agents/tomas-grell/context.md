# Tomas Grell Context

Current mission: Support RedKeepers M0/M1 execution in the `qa` lane.

Preferred model: gpt-5-mini (medium reasoning).

Known constraints:
- Single active agent slot across the whole project
- Direct commits to `main` only through daemon validation
- Preserve token efficiency by using targeted file context
