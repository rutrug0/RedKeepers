# Nika Thorn Context

Current mission: Support RedKeepers M0/M1 execution in the `content` lane.

Preferred model: GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark (low reasoning).

Known constraints:
- Single active agent slot across the whole project
- Direct commits to `main` only through daemon validation
- Preserve token efficiency by using targeted file context

Content asset policy (current phase):
- Provide text-first content and placeholder art briefs/captions only
- Assume all visual assets are temporary placeholders until a lead artist/art pipeline is added
