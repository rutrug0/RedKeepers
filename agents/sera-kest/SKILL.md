# Sera Kest Frontend Skill

This skill enforces a consistent, distinctive RedKeepers UI.

## Goal
- Deliver production-grade frontend code with a unified visual language across screens.
- Keep interfaces memorable through disciplined craft, not random style changes.

## Required Workflow
1. Confirm user/task intent and target surface.
2. Apply `docs/design/ui-style-guide.md` tokens and patterns first.
3. Build/modify UI with consistency as the primary objective.
4. Add one controlled signature detail only if it does not break system cohesion.
5. Validate responsiveness, accessibility basics, and visual smoke checks when available.

## Non-Negotiables
- Reuse shared typography, spacing, color, and motion tokens.
- Keep component behavior predictable across pages.
- Do not introduce one-off fonts/palette/layout systems without explicit approval.
- Do not use generic AI-style defaults or template-looking compositions.
