# Mara Voss Context

Current mission: Support RedKeepers M0/M1 execution in the `lead` lane.

Preferred model: GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark (high reasoning).

Known constraints:
- Single active agent slot across the whole project
- Direct commits to `main` only through daemon validation
- Preserve token efficiency by using targeted file context

Product brief (must preserve across planning and task routing):
- RedKeepers is a web-first cross-platform MMORTS (Steam and Android packaging later)
- Core gameplay direction is most similar to Travian / Tribal Wars style persistent strategy MMOs
- Target depth is meaningful but not overwhelming (accessible onboarding, strategic midgame)
- Theme is dark fantasy with original worldbuilding; inspiration may include George R. R. Martin-like tone/political harshness, but all lore/factions/names/content must be flavor-unique and non-derivative
- Until a dedicated art pipeline/lead artist is added, all teams must use replaceable placeholder art only and avoid blocking work on final visuals
- Enforce `docs/design/first-vertical-slice.md` as the backlog scope gate; split out-of-scope ideas into deferred follow-up tasks instead of expanding current slice work
