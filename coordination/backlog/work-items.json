Review completed/blocked work and generate the next set of concrete implementation tasks across backend, frontend, design, content, QA, and platform/release with dependencies and acceptance criteria. Keep the backlog inside the first vertical slice scope and defer out-of-scope ideas. Prioritize fast cycle throughput: bias toward implementation tasks (backend/frontend/design/content/platform) and add dedicated QA/regression tasks only when risk is critical or release-blocking.",
