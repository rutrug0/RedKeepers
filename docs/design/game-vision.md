# Game Vision

RedKeepers is a dark-fantasy MMORTS with moderate depth, long-term progression, and faction asymmetry.

Genre and reference direction:
- Core reference style: Travian / Tribal Wars-style persistent-world strategy MMO (settlement growth, resource management, timing, conflict, diplomacy)
- Platform strategy: web-first, later packaged for Steam and Android
- Creative direction: inspired by grim/dark fantasy sensibilities (including the political and harsh atmosphere associated with George R. R. Martin-style fantasy), but the world, factions, lore, names, and mechanics must remain original and non-derivative

Design principles:
- Strategic depth without overwhelming onboarding
- Persistent world consequences
- Strong faction identity and grim atmosphere
- Original setting inspired by dark fantasy, not derivative worldbuilding

Art production policy (current phase):
- Use placeholder art assets only during M0/M1/M2 prototyping
- Placeholder art should be easy to replace (stable file names/IDs and manifest references)
- Do not block gameplay, UI, or systems work on final art generation
