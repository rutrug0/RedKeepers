# Game Vision

RedKeepers is a dark-fantasy MMORTS with moderate depth, long-term progression, and faction asymmetry.

Design principles:
- Strategic depth without overwhelming onboarding
- Persistent world consequences
- Strong faction identity and grim atmosphere
- Original setting inspired by dark fantasy, not derivative worldbuilding
