# Factions and Civilizations (V1 Concept Draft)

This draft defines the first playable civilization set for RedKeepers. It targets moderate asymmetry: each civilization changes priorities and timing windows, but all still use the same core settlement loop (gather, build, train, scout, raid/defend, expand).

## V1 Design Goals

- Deliver strong faction identity without requiring players to relearn the whole game per civilization.
- Keep early progression readable: one signature mechanic active in the first hours, additional nuance unlocked later.
- Support classic MMORTS decision-making (timing, scouting, logistics, diplomacy) with civilization-specific strengths and liabilities.

## Shared Rules (Onboarding Guardrails)

All civilizations in v1 share:
- Same base resource categories and settlement UI structure
- Same core building families (economy, military, defense, logistics)
- Same expansion flow (starter settlement -> second settlement -> regional specialization)
- Same combat model fundamentals (infantry/ranged/cavalry/siege/counter relationships)

Civilization asymmetry is introduced through:
- 1 economy/logistics trait
- 1 military doctrine trait
- 1 unique settlement structure
- 3-4 signature units (not full bespoke rosters in v1)

This keeps cognitive load moderate while still creating meaningful faction choice.

## Civilization Set (V1)

## 1. Cinder Throne Legates

Theme: Ash-choked frontier garrisons ruled by oath-bound magistrates and branded levies. Order is maintained through punishment, ration discipline, and fortified roads.

Playstyle summary:
- Defensive-expansion civ with stable economy and strong midgame sieges
- Best for players who want reliable progression and durable settlements
- Lower raid burst than faster/skirmish-oriented factions

Core asymmetry:
- `Ration Law` (economy/logistics trait): Garrisoned troops consume less upkeep while stationed at home settlements; field armies consume normal upkeep.
- `Road Wardens` (military/logistics trait): Reinforcements move faster between owned settlements connected by road infrastructure.

Unique structure:
- `Cinder Tribunal`:
  - Boosts public order / reduces early unrest penalties
  - Unlocks levy-to-regular infantry upgrade line
  - Enables defensive edicts (choose one active bonus at a time)

Unit identity (signature units):
- `Brand Levies` (early infantry): Cheap, fast to train, weak attack, solid for walls/garrisons
- `Tribunal Crossmen` (ranged): Accurate defensive ranged unit with high wall synergy
- `Ash Riders` (cavalry): Medium cavalry tuned for interception, not deep raiding
- `Ember Rams` (siege): Earlier access to basic siege engines than other civs

Strengths:
- Forgiving opener and strong homeland defense
- Efficient troop rotation between owned settlements
- Predictable midgame power spike with siege access

Weaknesses:
- Limited early raid pressure
- Lower peak mobility in open-field warfare
- Can feel resource-tight when maintaining large expeditionary armies

Complexity rating: Low (recommended onboarding civilization)

## 2. Mirebound Covenant

Theme: Marsh citadels, rot-priests, and reed-cloaked warbands that survive by patience, poison, and hidden routes through drowned ground.

Playstyle summary:
- Attrition and harassment civ with strong scouting and disruption tools
- Rewards timing, map reading, and selective engagements
- More fragile in direct siege races

Core asymmetry:
- `Drowned Paths` (logistics trait): Armies suffer reduced movement penalties in swamp/wetland regions; scouts gain improved vision in those regions.
- `Spoilcraft` (economy trait): Raids return a small amount of preserved supplies (bonus resource yield) even when the main haul is modest.

Unique structure:
- `Fen Reliquary`:
  - Converts a portion of raid gains into ritual stores used for poison/ambush upgrades
  - Improves scout recovery time
  - Unlocks region intel actions (short-duration scouting boosts)

Unit identity (signature units):
- `Reed Stalkers` (scouts/skirmishers): Fast reconnaissance with high escape chance
- `Bog Spearmen` (infantry): Cheap anti-cavalry line, weak armor, strong in defense/ambush contexts
- `Rot Slingers` (ranged): Applies short attrition debuff to enemy armies after combat (v1 simple duration-based effect)
- `Mire Hounds` (light cavalry/beasts): Fast raiders with low carry capacity but strong pursuit

Strengths:
- Excellent scouting and harassment pressure
- Strong localized advantage in wetland regions
- Efficient at chipping stronger opponents over time

Weaknesses:
- Weakest direct wall-breaking tools in v1
- Fragile frontline if forced into fair fights
- Requires better scouting discipline to realize full value

Complexity rating: Medium

## 3. Graveforge Clans

Theme: Quarry-forts and black forges carved into dead hills, where clan-smiths bind ancestor oaths into iron and raise slow, relentless hosts.

Playstyle summary:
- Economy-through-industry civ with elite infantry and resilient defenses
- Slower early tempo, stronger scaling through production efficiency
- Favours organized alliance roles and planned offensives

Core asymmetry:
- `Stonebound Works` (economy trait): Building upgrades for military/defense structures cost less stone/iron but take slightly longer.
- `Clan Muster` (military trait): Heavy infantry train slower individually, but batch training queues are more efficient.

Unique structure:
- `Ancestor Forge`:
  - Improves heavy infantry equipment quality
  - Unlocks one-time settlement forge choices (offense-focused or defense-focused)
  - Provides repair efficiency bonus for defensive siege damage

Unit identity (signature units):
- `Pit Guard` (heavy infantry): Durable frontline with high anti-infantry staying power
- `Chainthrowers` (ranged): Shorter range, armor-piercing support unit
- `Tithe Boars` (shock cavalry/beasts): Hard-hitting charge unit with slow recovery
- `Woe Trebuchet` (siege): Late-arriving but highly effective siege engine

Strengths:
- Strong late-midgame settlement durability
- High-value armies once industry matures
- Excellent alliance anvil / frontline role

Weaknesses:
- Slow start and vulnerable early expansion timing
- Punishing if scouting is neglected (armies are expensive)
- Lower flexibility when reacting to fast raiders

Complexity rating: Medium (economy timing focused)

## Asymmetry and Balance Intent (V1)

The v1 balance target is "different answers to the same problems," not radically different game rules.

- Cinder Throne Legates: safest opener, strongest defensive logistics
- Mirebound Covenant: best scouting/harassment and terrain exploitation
- Graveforge Clans: best scaling infrastructure and heavy army quality

Each civilization should remain viable for:
- Solo/duo frontier play
- Alliance warfare roles
- Offensive and defensive progression paths

## Complexity Moderation (Explicit Justification)

To protect onboarding readability, v1 deliberately avoids:
- Civilization-exclusive resource types at game start
- Entirely unique combat subsystems per civilization
- Large rosters with overlapping specialist units
- Multi-step ritual/crafting trees before players learn core settlement play

Complexity is staged instead:
- Early game: one clear identity bonus + one obvious unit style
- Mid game: unique structure choices and doctrine expression
- Later game: alliance role specialization via normal expansion and tech pacing

This keeps civilization choice meaningful on day one while preserving room for deeper faction mechanics in later milestones.

## Follow-up Design Hooks (Post-v1)

- Add a 4th civilization only after v1 matchup clarity is validated
- Expand regional terrain interactions beyond wetlands (snow, ashlands, broken roads)
- Add advanced civilization doctrines as opt-in midgame choices rather than baseline complexity
