# Client Cross-Platform Strategy

RedKeepers will be web-first, then packaged for Steam and Android.

## Initial Direction

- Primary client: web application (desktop-first with responsive mobile support)
- Steam early path: desktop wrapper around web app
- Android early path: WebView/Capacitor wrapper around web app

This preserves fast iteration while deferring native optimization.
